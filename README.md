# Taskly Backend (Spring Boot)

A task manager backend: sign up and sign in, manage your profile and avatar, and create, filter, sort and paginate to-do tasks. It is a REST API built with Spring Boot 4 and PostgreSQL, organised as a modular monolith with Domain-Driven Design and Clean Architecture. It is a Java port of the Express version and keeps the same HTTP contract.

The browser client is a separate Taskly frontend that talks to this API.

**Stack:** Java 25 · Spring Boot 4 · Spring Web MVC · Spring Security · Spring Data JPA · PostgreSQL 18 · Flyway · JWT (Nimbus) · bcrypt · JUnit 5 · Docker · GitHub Actions

## Quick start

Requires JDK 25 and Docker.

```sh
cd taskly-docker
make docker/dev-up
cd ../taskly-backend
cp .env.example .env
openssl rand -base64 32
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Paste the generated value into `AUTH_SECRET` in `.env`. The API runs at http://localhost:8080 and pgAdmin at http://localhost:8081 (login `admin@taskly.dev` / `admin`, server host `taskly-postgres`, user `dev_user`, password `dev_pass`). Flyway migrations run automatically on startup. Values in `.env` are read from the working directory and can also be provided as regular environment variables.

| Goal               | Command                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run in development | `./mvnw spring-boot:run`                                                      |
| Build the jar      | `./mvnw -DskipTests package`                                                  |
| Run the jar        | `java -jar target/taskly-backend.jar`                                         |
| Seed demo data     | `java -jar target/taskly-backend.jar --spring.main.web-application-type=none --taskly.seed.enabled=true` |
| Run with Docker    | `make docker/up` (from `taskly-docker`)                                       |
| Seed in Docker     | `make docker/seed` (from `taskly-docker`)                                     |
| Stop Docker        | `make docker/down` (from `taskly-docker`)                                     |

`make docker/up` creates `taskly-docker/.env` with a random database password and `AUTH_SECRET` on the first run, then starts PostgreSQL and the API and waits until both are healthy. `PORT` overrides the host port in the Docker setup. The container always listens on port 8080. Demo login after seeding: `johndoe123@mail.com` / `password123`.

## Features

- **Authentication**: sign up, sign in and sign out with a JWT stored in an HTTP-only cookie.
- **Users**: list users, update the profile, upload an avatar and delete the account.
- **Tasks**: create, view, update and delete tasks.
- **Listing**: filter by status, sort and paginate tasks.
- **Platform**: versioned Flyway migrations, request logging, graceful shutdown, health checks on `/` and `/actuator/health`.

## Architecture

### Project layout

```
taskly-backend/
  src/main/java/com/taskly/backend/
    config/        typed properties, security, adapter wiring, seed runner
    shared/        errors, ids, event bus, HTTP and persistence helpers
    users/         authentication and user management
    tasks/         task management
  src/main/resources/
    application.yaml
    db/migration/  Flyway migrations
  src/test/java/   unit and integration suites
taskly-docker/
  taskly-backend/Dockerfile
  docker-compose.local.yml
  docker-compose.dev.yml
  Makefile
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

### Module layout

```
<module>/
  domain/          entities, value objects, repository and service contracts
  application/     use cases
  infrastructure/  JPA, JWT, bcrypt and file system adapters
  presentation/    REST controllers
```

### Dependency rules

- Dependencies point inward: presentation and infrastructure depend on application, application depends on domain.
- Modules never import each other. They communicate through the in-process event bus, so deleting a user removes that user's tasks.
- Authentication is cross-cutting: a servlet filter in `config` verifies the cookie and exposes the user id to controllers as `AuthenticatedUser`.

## Database

Schema changes live in `src/main/resources/db/migration` as Flyway `V<number>__<name>.sql` files. Flyway applies pending files in order on every startup and records them in `flyway_schema_history`.

| Table   | Notes                                                                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `users` | `id` UUID, case-insensitive unique `email` and `username`, `password_hash`, `avatar_file`, timestamps |
| `tasks` | `id` UUID, `owner_id` UUID (foreign key to `users`), `due` timestamptz, `status` and `priority` limited by `CHECK`, indexed on `(owner_id, status)` |

- Identifiers are UUIDs. API responses expose them as `_id` and `owner`.
- Listings are ordered by `created_at` and `id`, so ties on the creation time still give a stable order.
- `tasks.owner_id` references `users(id)` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. The `user.deleted` event still removes a user's tasks.
- `status` accepts `todo`, `in_progress` and `done` (default `todo`). `priority` accepts `low`, `medium` and `high`.
- `due` is stored as a timestamp with time zone and returned as an ISO 8601 UTC string, for example `2026-12-08T10:00:00.000Z`.

## API

All routes are under `/api/v1`. Routes other than sign up and sign in require the `taskly_token` cookie.

| Method | Path                | Purpose                                         |
| ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | `/auth/signup`      | Register and sign in                            |
| POST   | `/auth/signin`      | Sign in                                         |
| GET    | `/auth/signout`     | Sign out                                        |
| GET    | `/users`            | List users, filter with `username` and `email`  |
| GET    | `/users/{id}`       | Get a user                                      |
| PATCH  | `/users/update/{id}`| Update own profile                              |
| POST   | `/users/upload/{id}`| Upload own avatar (`avatar` field, 2 MB)        |
| DELETE | `/users/delete/{id}`| Delete own account                              |
| POST   | `/tasks/create`     | Create a task                                   |
| GET    | `/tasks/user/{id}`  | List own tasks with `status`, `orderBy`, `page` |
| GET    | `/tasks/{id}`       | Get a task                                      |
| PATCH  | `/tasks/{id}`       | Update a task                                   |
| DELETE | `/tasks/{id}`       | Delete a task                                   |

Errors are returned as `{ "status": <code>, "message": "<text>" }`. Unknown routes return `{ "message": "Not found" }` with status 404.

## Testing

| Layer       | Command         | What it proves                                          |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unit        | `./mvnw test`   | Domain, use cases, JWT, bcrypt and file storage, no I/O |
| Integration | `./mvnw verify` | Full HTTP flows on a real PostgreSQL (`*IT` classes)    |

Integration tests need a PostgreSQL server where the user can create databases. They read `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and default to the development database from `make docker/dev-up`. The suite creates its own temporary database, runs the migrations and drops it when the JVM exits.

```sh
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres ./mvnw verify
```

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs these jobs:

1. **Commitlint**: commit message linting on pull requests, configured in `.commitlintrc.json`.
2. **Build**: compiles and packages the application with JDK 25.
3. **Tests**: unit and integration suites against a PostgreSQL 18 service.
4. **Docker**: builds the image, starts the Compose stack, then checks `/`, signs up a user and runs the seed.

## Limits

- The API needs a running PostgreSQL.
- Uploaded avatars are stored on local disk and served from `/images/users`. The Compose stack keeps them in the `taskly-avatars` volume.
- Events are delivered in-process, so the app runs as a single instance.

## Migrating from the Express version

- `DATABASE_URL` is now a JDBC URL and the credentials moved to `DATABASE_USER` and `DATABASE_PASSWORD`.
- `LOG_TO_FILE` is replaced by `LOG_FILE`. An empty value disables the log file.
- Existing sessions stay valid: tokens use the same HS256 secret, payload and cookie name, and bcrypt hashes are compatible.
- An existing PostgreSQL database created by the Express version already contains the tables. Start the app once with `SPRING_FLYWAY_BASELINE_ON_MIGRATE=true` and `SPRING_FLYWAY_BASELINE_VERSION=2` so Flyway records them as applied.
